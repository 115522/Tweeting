<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
Clustering tweets by utlizing cosine Distance metric and K-means clustering algorithm.



## Introduction
Data redundancy is an important problem of Twitter. Twitter users are likely to generate similar tweets (e.g., using the Retweet function) about some popular topics/events.
a result of a huge number of tweets which let  tweetos not interested to loss time about reading for the same topic many tweets     
  So by clustering similar tweets together, we can generate a more concise and organized representation of the raw tweets, which will be very useful for busy Tweetos to read only one tweet per class
  
## Project Objectives

<li>Aim of this project is to cluster and label the text  tweets.</br>
  So
when a new tweet is added to the corpus, it must be labeled easily without performing the full clustering again</li>

### KeyWord

<B>Text mining  /  clustering   /  NLP /  tweepy  / NLTK  / twitter API </B>






## Project scope

<li>Data gathering (streaming tweets )</li> <li> Data Processing and Wrangling (cleaning text tweets and apply NLP to text)</li>
<li>Vectorization (numerical data representation part) <li>cosine distance from nltk </li>  <li> apply k-means</li> <li>label clusters </li>







<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Installation

1. Get a twitter API Key 
     Try this link </br>

2. Install tweepy </br>
```sh
  !pip install tweepy 
  ```
    
  
3. Install NLTK </br>
```sh
 !pip install nltk
  ```
  ```sh
 conda install -c anaconda nltk
  ```
4. Install stopwords from nltk graphic ( download nltk )

## Evaluating Results
 
K-Means algorithm has been executed by

-  data representation method :TF-IDF 
- Distance metrics  : Cosine Similarity
- k =6  values (2 to 6 clusters)
